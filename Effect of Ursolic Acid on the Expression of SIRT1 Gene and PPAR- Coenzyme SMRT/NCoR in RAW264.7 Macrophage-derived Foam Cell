Fig.3 Effect of ursolic acid (UA) and astragalus polysaccharides (APS) on the gene expression of SIRT1, PPARγ, NCoR and SMRT in macrophage-derived foam cells
(A)The results of showed that the expression of SIRT1, PPARγ, NCoR and SMRT increased with the increase of UA concentration. Compared with PPARγ, the expression of SIRT1 gene in UA group was significantly increased (P <0.01), which may be related to the expression of SIRT1 gene PPARγ cofactor NCoR And SMRT binding inhibition of PPARγgene expression; compared with SMRT gene expression, NCoR gene expression was significantly enhanced (P <0.01), SIRT1 gene coenzyme NCoR binding SMRT factor significantly. (B)The results of showed that the expression of SIRT1, PPARγ, NCoR and SMRT was not obvious and the expression of SIRT1 was low in APS group compared with UA group, which indicated that APS had a weak effect on SIRT1 gene; (C)PPARγgene was not significantly affected by 10 mg·L-1 APS The expression of SIRT1mRNA in UA group was lower than that in APS group (P <0.05). (D)The expression of SIRT1mRNA in UA group was lower than that in APS group; (E)The level of NCoRmRNA in UA group was significantly higher than that in UA group (P <0.05); (F)The level of NCoRmRNA in UA group was significantly higher than that in UA group Significantly enhanced(P <0.05) .
